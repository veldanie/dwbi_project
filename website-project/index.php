<h1><center>Digital Divide in the World</center></h1> 

<p>The world we live in is constantly changing. The advancement in technology and information is propelling this change in even faster rate. So, inevitably, some people are going to be left behind. Although the cost for computers and internet continues to lessen, a good percentage of people in the world still cannot afford the it. This gap between those who do and those who do not have access to computers or the Internet has come to be known as the "digital divide."</p>

<p>And this divide is even more conspicuous if you take into consideration the divide between the countries.</p>

<p>Using the data from International Telecommunication Union (ITU), here is the map illustrating the digital divide we have in the world today, according to the percentage of Internet Users.</p>
<img src="img/Digital Divide.png" width="100%"><br>
<p>This digital divide is driven my many socio-economic factors, and using some statistical techniques and analysis, we have come up with some socio-economic factors that affect most in creating this digital divide.</p>

<p>We have also calculated the fitted values of ITU indicators for different countries and compared it with their original values to identity the outlier countries, i.e the countries that are out performing and underperforming.
</p>

<p>Finally, we have also come up with the identification of priority countries for the telecom development aid. ITU identifies annually a number of countries as being the worldâ€™s least connected countries (LCCs) based on a combination of telecommunication indicators for each country. About 40 countries are LCCs out of a total 165 countries with data available.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, a number of developing countries do not produce telecommunication statistics, and therefore it is not known whether they are LCCs or not. For several of these countries data from the World Bank database and Google price benchmarking are available.</p>

<p>These data will be used to develop a classification model in order to fill in the blanks in the map of LCCs. Because data availability will be reduced and limit the performance of the model, the results will be presented with some measure of uncertainty associated with the prediction.</p>
